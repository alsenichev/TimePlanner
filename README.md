# Introduction 
This is a replacement of the Maxdone web service which has been discontinued.

# Getting Started
The authentication is not implemented and the release version is not deployed anywhere. Maybe I'll do it in the future. The only possible way to deploy this application is to install it as a Windows service locally.

# Build and Test
Build and deploy pipelines are nece-to-haves but not now.
